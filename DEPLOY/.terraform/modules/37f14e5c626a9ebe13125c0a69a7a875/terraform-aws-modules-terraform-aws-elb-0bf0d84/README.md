AWS Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) Terraform module
================================================

Terraform module which creates ELB resources on AWS.

These types of resources are supported:

* [ELB](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/r/elb.html)
* [ELB Attachment](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/r/elb_attachment.html)

Root module calls these modules which can also be used separately to create independent resources:

* [elb](https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-elb/tree/master/modules/elb) - creates ELB
* [elb_attachment](https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-elb/tree/master/modules/elb_attachment) - creates ELB attachment

Usage
-----

```hcl
module "elb_http" {
  source = "terraform-aws-modules/elb/aws"

  name = "elb-example"

  subnets         = ["subnet-12345678", "subnet-87654321"]
  security_groups = ["sg-12345678"]
  internal        = false

  listener = [
    {
      instance_port     = "80"
      instance_protocol = "HTTP"
      lb_port           = "80"
      lb_protocol       = "HTTP"
    },
  ]

  health_check = [
    {
      target              = "HTTP:80/"
      interval            = 30
      healthy_threshold   = 2
      unhealthy_threshold = 2
      timeout             = 5
    },
  ]

  access_logs = [
    {
      bucket = "my-access-logs-bucket"
    },
  ]

  // ELB attachments
  number_of_instances = 2
  instances           = ["i-06ff41a77dfb5349d", "i-4906ff41a77dfb53d"]
  
  tags = {
    Owner       = "user"
    Environment = "dev"
  }
}
```

Examples
--------

* [Complete ELB example](https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-elb/tree/master/examples/complete)

Known Issues/Limitations
------------------------
* Support for HTTPS is a common requirment for Internet facing ELBs. However, there is a known Terraform limitation with providing a dynamic computed value for the ```ssl_id_certificate``` parameter in nested block structures (Refer to: https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/16582#issuecomment-342570913).
